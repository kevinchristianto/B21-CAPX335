	(1, 'Blast', 'Fungus', 'Magnaporthe oryzae', 'Blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. It can affect all above ground parts of a rice plant: leaf, collar, node, neck, parts of panicle, and sometimes leaf sheath. Blast can occur wherever blast spores are present. It occurs in areas with low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures favor the development of the disease. Rice can have blast in all growth stages. However, leaf blast incidence tends to lessen as plants mature and develop adult plant resistance to the disease.'),
	(2, 'Bacterial Blight', 'Bacteria', 'Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae', 'Bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves. The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants. It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25?34Â°C, with relative humidity above 70%. It is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rains occur, allowing the disease-causing bacteria to easily spread through ooze droplets on lesions of infected plants. Bacterial blight can be severe in susceptible rice varieties under high nitrogen fertilization.'),
	(3, 'Tungro', 'Virus', 'RTBV/RTSV', 'Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses, which are transmitted by leafhoppers. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains. Tungro infects cultivated rice, some wild rice relatives and other grassy weeds commonly found in rice paddies. Tungro disease viruses are transmitted from one plant to another by leafhoppers that feed on tungro-infected plants. The most efficient vector is the green leafhopper. Leafhoppers can acquire the viruses from any part of the infected plant by feeding on it, even for a short time. It can, then, immediately transmit the viruses to other plants within 5?7 days. The viruses do not remain in the leafhopper\'s body unless it feeds again on an infected plant and re-acquires the viruses. Tungro infection can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage.');
